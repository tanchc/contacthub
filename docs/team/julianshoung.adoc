== Project: ContactHub
ContactHub is a desktop address book application designed for NUS students, created as part of NUS modules CS2101 and CS2103T.
The project constraints were to create an addressbook application where input was handled by a  CLI, while output was handled by a GUI.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

=== Enhancement Added: NUSMods Implementation

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=nusmods]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

The enhancement allows students, our target audience, to conveniently check
useful information within the application using only the CLI. NUSMods was chosen as it is popular among NUS students
and provides up-to-date information.

Checking module and venue information were decided to be the most relevant features implementable, while still keeping within
the given constraints of the project. It provides a quick, easy way to access this information without having to leave the application.

==== Justification

Having multiple classes in different locations is common for NUS students, getting around the campus
can be daunting especially for new students. These quick references have been added for students'
convenience.
