=== Enhancement Added: Add birthday property in Person Model

==== External behaviour

=== Adding a birthday property to a Contact [Since v1.1]

Add a birthday property to the Contact in Contacthub. +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER... b/BIRTHDAY e/EMAIL... a/ADDRESS [m/MODULE]...` +

****
* Adds a birthday property to the Contact.
* The birthday must be of valid format.
****

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 b/10/10/1980 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` +
* `add n/Betsy Crowe m/CS2101 e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 b/18/08/1989 m/criminal` +
Sets the contact with the following details.


==== Justification
The enhancement allows the user to save another information of the contact that the user wishes to add. As our target
audience is students, they are likely to celebrate birthdays for each other often. The birthday property also allows
the addition of other enhancements like sorting the list by birthday or notifications of contacts with their birthdays
 occurring today.

==== Implementation

=== Birthday property in person model

The birthday property is facilitated by a `Birthday` class, which is a property class of the `person` class. It allows
the user to add a birthday field to each of the contacts.

The `Birthday` class stores the birthday information of the contact and will be displayed in the contact's information.
The birthday information can be edited using the `edit` command.

Whenever the user adds a new contact using the `AddCommand`, a new `Birthday` object is instantiated.
The `Birthday` class checks the validity of the birthday string, if valid, a new `Person` object would be
instantiated, otherwise an IllegalValueException would be thrown.

The birthday property is implemented this way.

[source,java]
----

public class Birthday {
   public Birthday(string birthday)throws IllegalValueException {
       // ...birthday logic...
       }
}
----

Suppose the user wants to add a new contact. The user fills in the information for `AddCommand`.

The user then executes the `AddCommand`.

image::birthday2.PNG[width="300]

==== Design consideration

**Aspects:** Implementation of birthday class +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implements in `person` class. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

=== Enhancement Added: Adding a photo to a contact in Contacthub

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=addphoto]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Adding a photo to each contact of ContactHub would make the contacts more recognisable to the user, hence easier
identification of contacts.
Furthermore ContactHub's target audience is university students, therefore to make the application more interesting
 and youthful, so as to add a fun factor when using ContactHub.

=== Enhancement Added: Keyboard Shortcuts

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=keyboardshortcuts]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Justification

When using ContactHub, it is sometimes quite a hassle when using the command line. Especially when adding
numerous contacts or when typing incorrect information. Hence, with keyboard shortcuts, using the command line
would be much more easier and time saving. This would benefit the user greatly as well as attract more users to
use ContactHub.

=== Enhancement Proposed:

* Using NUSMods as an additional feature.
* Using IVLE as an additional feature.

=== Other contributions

* Assigned random tag colors to random tags (Pull requests https://github.com[#52])
* Add user stories into developer guide (Pull requests https://github.com[#49])
